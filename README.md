# To-Do-Python-Tkinter
I have created a To-Do using python-tkinter, list and some basics python concepts.

TKINTER: Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface.

Python-List: Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages. Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool in Python. A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects.


List Methods:

Append() 	Add an element to the end of the list,
Extend() 	Add all elements of a list to the another list,
Insert() 	Insert an item at the defined index,
Remove() 	Removes an item from the list,
Pop() 	Removes and returns an element at the given index,
Clear() 	Removes all items from the list,
Index() 	Returns the index of the first matched item,
Count() 	Returns the count of number of items passed as an argument,
Sort() 	Sort items in a list in ascending order,
Reverse() 	Reverse the order of items in the list,
copy() 	Returns a copy of the list.
